                important. If you're the best at your specialized knowledge but
                can't work as a team, communicate, or manage your time, then you wouldn't meet the
                standards the job is asking for you to meet.

                you won't be able to help others, receive help, and you may becomes less responsible, and overall not 
                perform well at doing your job.

                Teamwork is very important in a work environment
                because it allows us to share our ideas together and to motivate each
                other to be able to produce a great product.
